# Architecture Overview of Blocryp Protocols

This document outlines the high-level architecture of Blocryp's open protocols and their role in the Web3 fintech ecosystem.

## Core Components

- **Decentralized Identity Layer:** Enables secure, verifiable digital identities using blockchain-backed credentials.
- **Proof of Reputation (PoR):** A novel consensus mechanism that prioritizes trust and reputation metrics over pure computational power.
- **IP Rights Management:** Protocols to enforce and manage intellectual property rights natively on-chain.
- **Interoperable SDKs & APIs:** Facilitates easy integration with financial institutions, wallets, and dApps.

## Design Principles

- **Modularity:** Each protocol component functions independently yet composes seamlessly.
- **Security-first:** Cryptographic proofs and zero-knowledge proofs ensure privacy and data integrity.
- **Scalability:** Layer-2 solutions and optimized smart contracts maintain high throughput.
